This is the structure: {\"action\": string, \"complement\": string, \"property\": string}. For example, for the prompt 'Locate a dish in the kitchen then get it and give it to Angel in the living room', the result would be: \"{\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\"action\": \"go\", \"complement\": \"kitchen\"},\n        {\"action\": \"find\", \"complement\": \"dish\"},\n        {\"action\": \"grab\", \"complement\": \"dish\"},\n        {\"action\": \"go\", \"complement\": \"living room\"},\n        {\"action\": \"find\", \"complement\": \"Angel\"},\n        {\"action\": \"approach\", \"complement\": \"Angel\"},\n        {\"action\": \"give\", \"complement\": \"dish\"}\n    ]\n}\".

In order to write it, you have to write a JSON response that contains a list of objects. Each of which contain two string keys, one for the action and another for the complement. This is the structure: {\"action\": string, \"complement\": string, \"property\": string}. For example, for the prompt 'Locate a dish in the kitchen then get it and give it to Angel in the living room', the result would be: \"{\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\"action\": \"go\", \"complement\": \"kitchen\"},\n        {\"action\": \"find\", \"complement\": \"dish\"},\n        {\"action\": \"grab\", \"complement\": \"dish\"},\n        {\"action\": \"go\", \"complement\": \"living room\"},\n        {\"action\": \"find\", \"complement\": \"Angel\"},\n        {\"action\": \"approach\", \"complement\": \"Angel\"},\n        {\"action\": \"give\", \"complement\": \"dish\"}\n    ]\n}\".

Another important thing is that when we give you the general task, some complements are grouped in categories.

This is the structure: {\"action\": string, \"complement\": string, \"property\": string}. For example, for the prompt 'Locate a dish in the kitchen then get it and give it to Angel in the living room', the result would be: \"{\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\"action\": \"go\", \"complement\": \"kitchen\"},\n        {\"action\": \"find\", \"complement\": \"dish\"},\n        {\"action\": \"grab\", \"complement\": \"dish\"},\n        {\"action\": \"go\", \"complement\": \"living room\"},\n        {\"action\": \"find\", \"complement\": \"Angel\"},\n        {\"action\": \"approach\", \"complement\": \"Angel\"},\n        {\"action\": \"give\", \"complement\": \"dish\"}\n    ]\n}\".

For example: apple, banana and lemon are all of them in the fruits category; cola, milk and red wine are all of them in the drinks category.
